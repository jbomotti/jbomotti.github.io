        <b>Pairing</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="question">What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</li>
          <p>Pairing with others can be a lot of fun. It can also be a great opportunity to grow culturally. No two sessions are the same, so you are never sure what to expect. Nerves definitely play a big role, especially before the start of a pairing and during the opening few minutes. That seems to be decreasing as the weeks go on, but it is certainly still there.</p>
        <li class="question">Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</li>
          <p>It can be really rewarding when you and your pair have been struggling on a particular release for a while and then one or both of you figure out the solution. It is also great when Navigating if you are able to find what the Driver is looking for quickly, before you lose your momentum with the challenge.</p>
        <li class="question">Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</li>
          <p>It can sometimes be frustrating if you and your pair are at different places in the week's curriculum. Being on either end of that can be frustrating, but it can also be an excellent opportunity to learn from your pair or teach them.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Feedback</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="question">How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>
          <p>I was nervous about reading my feedback, at first. It took a while for some to show up and when it did I had three or four pieces to get through. That can be a lot to hear about yourself at once</p>
        <li class="question">Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</li>
          <p>Absolutely! The actionable constructive feedback that I received I have been incredibly grateful for. It has helped me identify areas I can focus on to improve future pairing sessions.</p>
        <li class="question">Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>
          <p>Based on feedback I have received, I will work on trying to be more vocal with what I want to try and what I think might be a good solution when I have a good understanding of the material. I tend to hold back and not want to interrupt even if I see things going in a direction that might not be productive.</p>
        <li class="question">How was it to write feedback?</li>
          <p>Writing feedback was a tough habit to get into. It is certainly best, from my experience, to do it as soon as your pairing session is over. That way all of the information is fresh in your mind, and you can give more specific feedback.</p>
        <li class="question">What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>
          <p>I think the most difficult part is giving feedback on a pairing session that went really well. It can be tough finding actionable feedback for a pair that seems to really understand the material and be adept at working the code.</p>
