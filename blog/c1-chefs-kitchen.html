        I can do this. There’s no doubt about it, the DBC experience is going to be intense. It is going to challenge me in more ways than I thought one program could. The video made me well aware of this, but is also made me aware of something else. Something very important. That I CAN do this!

          When I first considered doing a program like this, all I thought about was learning different languages and ways of solving problems. A bunch of challenges for my brain. The more I read about DBC, the more I noticed that this wasn’t going to be the only thing I would be learning and being challenged by. Watching the <a href=“https://vimeo.com/85001014”>Fireside Chat with Shereef</a> verified how true this is. As an introvert, I know that some of the social aspects are going to offer as much of a challenge as the coding itself, but I can’t, and won’t, let that stop me. I signed up for this to learn to be a “world class beginner” in every way that entails and that is what I am going to do. Even if it means having to push myself. I also know that I will have a great team working right along with me that I can help as much as they help me.

          That being said, I’m still nervous. However, I am also incredibly excited and look forward to starting Phase 1 more than ever before! I <em>know</em> I can do this, and I know that we can all do it as well. We’ll make the 2015 Fireflies the best cohort DBC has seen!
