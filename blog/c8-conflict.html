        Alright, coming into the second to last week of Phase 0 and it's time to talk about conflict! Or, you know, we could just, maybe, talk about anything else and just pretend it doesn't exist. You're cool with that, right? Unfortunately, as one who tries to avoid conflict at all costs, this is often how I think. It doesn't help, and it isn't healthy for myself or my relationship with the other person. A fellow Firefly put it quite eloquently when she said:
        <blockquote cite="http://kripple.github.io/blog/c8-conflict.html">
          My natural inclination is to avoid conflict. For my own personal development, I need to learn how to speak up when something bothers me. What I do instead (all too often) is nothing externally, but internally store the anger, sadness, or hurt feelings. This isn't healthy, fosters poor communication, and has probably stunted my efforts in learning to be tactful/assertive in my speaking.
